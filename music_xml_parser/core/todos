Hi Christon, it's me again: now the interval search notebook:
- Here the autodownload is fine! (But it's not possible to include several files at once, right?)
- The searches work fine (but I have to check them in detail again)
- However, the last column 'Onset' should be related to the measure: the beat position within the measure named in the column before! (btw: 'midi' doesn't need '.0')
- Unfortunately, it's not possible to give the columns new name with the 'mp.utils.display_table'-command (as in the statistics notebook), cf. the last query in the Notebook below: all new column names got, then, 'NaN'. Why is this function disabled?

Hi all, for our meeting tomorrow (10 am) I've only for issues:
- pandas dataframe: upbeat issue, documentation, testing with ground truth ...
- CAMAT: finalizing jupyter notebooks
- paper (for Routledge volume)
- follow-up application (- any concrete ideas, Egor?)
What else?
until tomorrow! Cheers, Martin
