# Computer-aided-music-analysis
## Please note that this project is still under construction. Still testing and documentation of the CAMAT is yet to be finalised. Please contact us for any questions or feedbacks.

Musical analysis courses are an integral part of both the musicological studies and the training of music teachers and musicians at universities and music colleges. The aim of the Fellowship project is to design, test, evaluate and convey several flexibly applicable teaching modules for music analysis using various computer-based analysis tools. The teaching modules are dedicated, among other things, to the computer-based annotation and visualization of sheet music texts and audio files, the statistical analysis of music corpora, the search for musical patterns (rhythms, melodies, harmony connections, etc.) and the comparison of interpretation. They are intended to supplement conventional analysis courses, are tested and evaluated in various courses at HfM Weimar and made available free of charge to a wider circle of interested parties via an Internet platform. Computers can be used as a tool for analyzing music texts and music recordings. With computer programs, you can quickly and reliably

* visualizes musical processes and structures,
* musical characteristics of the pieces in question (e.g. frequencies of pitches) statistically described 
* and search for certain patterns (e.g. melodic motifs).

This expands conventional approaches to analysis and opens up and explores new perspectives of musical analysis in musicology and music theory. On the one hand, the computer tools can be used to follow up analytical questions in a targeted manner, and on the other hand, a playful use of the tools and note files allows an discovery of unexpected connections - which can then lead to new analytical questions.

All software used in the teaching units is freely accessible and can be used royalty-free. In this way, the project follows the principle of OA, open access to publicly funded project results and independence from commercially oriented IT companies.

### Teaching units and modules

Two teaching units are provided here, which, based on music analytical questions, can be converted into different possibilities of computer-aided analysis of sheet music or Insert audio files. Each lesson consists of a basic module (Basics grades or Basics Audio) and an Advanced specialization. The teaching units can be used in self-study or within courses. The duration of the lessons is about three sessions of a 90-minute, with additional preparations, homework and optional in-depth studies.

### Resources and documentation

These pages contain information on the installation of the required software, a database of note files of several 1000 compositions, comprehensive documentation of the sheet music analysis programs developed in the project, and other materials.

### Research

Further information on the objectives, employees, publications, etc. of the project, links to similar research projects and publications can be found on the research page. The project Computer-aided Music Analysis in Digital Higher Education is located at the Institute of Musicology Weimar-Jena of the Franz Liszt Weimar University of Music. It is funded by the Thuringian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Science and Digital Change and the Stifterverband. The project sees itself as a contribution to Computational Musicology or Digital Musicology within the Digital Humanties.

The project is currently in the test phase. Feedback is welcome: analyse@hfm-weimar.de
